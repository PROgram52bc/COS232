1. What CIA component is/are compromised in this attack?
	Integrity. Because the attacker can do bad things on behalf of someone else. So the integrity of the attacker's identity is compromised, or in another way, the integrity of what the actual user intended to do was compromised.
2. Did SSL prevent the attack?
	No. Because the credential was no different from the actual user.
3. Did centralized-authentication prevent the attack?
	No. Because cookie was stored to pass the CA.
4. Was a client-side scripting language used to leverage the attack?
	No. It's something done by the server.
