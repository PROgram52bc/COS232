Questions:
1. 052
2. 'd'
3. 100
4. 0x73

Questions:
1. In step #1, what happens if you assign y[4] = 0x53; instead?
	Then the string becomes "TACO5" with an unknown number of garbage characters following it.
2. In step #2, why is there a null character? We didnâ€™t create one!
	C-strings in "this form" are automatically null-terminated.
3. In step #2, why did it work to specify an index of 4 on y2, a character pointer?
	An array is essentially the pointer containing the address of its first element. And indexing it with [] will advance the pointer and return the content in that address.

Questions:
1. What is the size of a variable that is a pointer?
	8 bytes.
2. When printing the hex value of poof_youre_a_32bit_int, are the bytes the same as the ones you entered manually into y?
	Yes, but the bytes are reversed.
